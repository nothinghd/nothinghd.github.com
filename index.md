I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of [Statistics](http://www.stat.iastate.edu), Iowa State University. My research interest is [interactive](https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas) statistical graphics, working with [Di](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~dicook) and [Heike](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann). I have been developing a few [R](http://www.r-project.org) packages either seriously or for [fun](http://cran.r-project.org/package=fun) (or both), such as [animation](http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation), [formatR](/formatR/), and [knitr](/knitr/). I founded a Chinese website called "[Capital of Statistics](http://cos.name)" in 2006 which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. I also initiated the first Chinese R conference in 2008. Besides statistics, I'm a big fan of [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui), [LyX](http://www.lyx.org) and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). I hate IE. I fall asleep when I see beamer slides, and I yell at people who use `\textbf{}` to write `\title{}`. I know I cannot eat code, so I cook almost every day to stay away from my computer for two hours. At the moment I'm doing intern at [Fred Hutchinson](http://www.fhcrc.org) in Seattle.

> 深情似海，问相逢初度，是何年纪？依约而今还记取，不是前生夙世。放学花前，题诗石上，春水园亭里。逢君一笑，人间无此欢喜。  
> 无奈苍狗看云，红羊数劫，惘惘休提起。客气渐多真气少，汨没心灵何已。千古声名，百年担负，事事违初意。心头阁住，儿时那种情味。
